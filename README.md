# dogname-ratings

Python tools to collaboratively rate dog names, with multiple raters using a shared folder (e.g. dropbox), for the prospective dog owners that need data to decide on a name.

Shared folder should contain:

-- dognames.py (validnames at top of script should be edited to include information about raters)

-- dognames.txt (initial list of dog names)

Initial list of dog names adapted from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kaz-A/dog_names/master/dogNames2.csv -- only names attested 5 or more times were included in dognames.txt (for efficiency's sake).
